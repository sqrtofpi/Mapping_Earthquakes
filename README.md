Module 13: Mapping Earthquakes with JS &amp; APIs

## Project Overview:

Working with Basil and Sadhana in mapping recent (within the past 7 days) earthquake data; they have requested additional esthetic and functional changes to our previous work. Among the additional requests were:

- Populating geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the D3 library (Data-Driven Documents),
- Adding multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins,
- Using the functions of JavaScript ES6 to add interactivity to maps,
- Rendering the maps on a local server.

## Preview of Results:
